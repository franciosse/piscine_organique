    "overview": "Principle Overview",
    "what": "What is an organic pool?",
    "whatDescription": "A natural pool works thanks to a balance between a swimming area and a filtration zone made up of aquatic plants, with no chemicals. Water naturally flows through the plants, which filter and purify the water. A living ecosystem that offers a healthy and pleasant swimming experience.",
    "how": "How does it work?",
    "howDescription": "The key elements of a healthy natural pool are:",
    "howDescription1": "Good water circulation (all the water must pass through the filtration area at least once a day)",
    "howDescription2": "Biological filtration (aquatic plants and microorganisms filter and purify the water).",
    "howDescription3": "These key elements maintain clean and healthy water.",
    "filtration": "Water Filtration",
    "filtrationDescription": "The filtration zone covers an area equivalent to the swimming area. It is made up of gravel and plants. These plants and their root systems act as a biological filter consuming nutrients and preventing algae growth. It is important to plant different species (iris, papyrus, pickerelweed, horsetail, water lilies, lotus...) because each has a specific role in the ecosystem.",
    "filtrationDescription1": "Water filtration in a natural pool is ensured by a system of aquatic plants and microorganisms working together to purify the water. Plant roots filter impurities, while microorganisms break down organic matter.",
    "circulation": "Water Circulation",
    "circulationDescription": "Water circulation is achieved through air pumps that gently move the water through the filtration zone. These pumps consume little energy, ensuring sustainable operation. Their power supply can be provided by solar panels for an even more ecological approach.",
    "circulationDescription1": "They are also safe for aquatic wildlife that will inhabit your organic pool.",
    "construction": "Construction",
    "constructioncosts": "Construction Costs",
    "constructionCostDescription": "Lower than a traditional pool. The main expense is the liner (several thousand euros), the rest consists of:",
    "constructionStep1": "Excavate and prepare the ground",
    "constructionStep2": "Install geotextile + liner + geotextile",
    "constructionStep3": "Install the PVC system and air pump",
    "constructionStep4": "Place rolled gravel and aquatic plants",
    "constructionStep5": "Install a deck and finishing touches",
    "constructionStep6": "Fill the pool with water",
    "constructionStep7": "Let the pool stabilize for 2 to 3 weeks/months",
    "constructionStep8": "Enjoy your biological pool!",
    "operationalCosts": "Operating Costs",
    "operationalCostsDescription": "Almost zero: air pump powered by solar energy, natural filtration provided by plants. Light maintenance in autumn (removing dead leaves) is sufficient.",
    "advantages": "Advantages",
    "advantagesDescription": "A biological pool offers many benefits:",
    "advantagesDescription1": "Soft, pure, and healthy water, free of chemicals. It is even drinkable!",
    "advantagesDescription2": "A living ecosystem that promotes biodiversity. Frogs, for example, help control mosquito populations.",
